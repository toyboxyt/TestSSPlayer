------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Terminology

  SpriteObject refers to a GameObject created to playback SpriteStudio animations, which has SsSprite script attached.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SpriteStudio versions

  Data output from SpriteStudio version 4.00.19 or later must be used.
  
  When saving motion data, select "motion text data (*.ssax)" as the file type.
  
  Next, save by checking
  Output data for SpriteStudioPlayer for Unity
  in the Save Option dialog box.
  
  See Animation data import procedure in usage.txt for the steps to import the data created with the above procedure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Checking the installed version

  Select About in the SpriteStudio menu located in the upper part of the Unity main window to check the version.

  SpriteStudioPlayer Version indicates the plugin version.
  Ssax File Version indicates the version of the .ssax file that can be read by the current plugin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cautions

  "Regarding display of translucent parts that have ColorBlending animation applied"
  
  For translucent parts that have ColorBlending animation applied, opacity is ignored in an OpenGL ES 1.x environment (early model iPhone/Android terminals).

  This is because the OpenGL ES 1.x environment does not support the use of CgProgram to handle ColorBlending intensity parameters and the parts opacity simultaneously.

  - SSAX file format specifications are subject to future change.
