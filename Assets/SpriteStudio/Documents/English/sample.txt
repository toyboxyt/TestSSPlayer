Samples
    BombParticle  Effect when a bee is hit in a GameScene.

    Data
        
        antarctic
            antarctic
                Use "Reference Source XY Offset" in foot movement.

            antarctic2
            antarctic3
                Arranged version of antarctic.
                With "ColorBlending," color is applied to the penguin after impact.

        BeeChameleon
            This combines the bee, chameleon, and background animation separately.

        button
            This has three types of button images and animations.
            Three types of animation can be created: normal status, focus status, and flash status when pressed.
            In addition, the buttons on the top portion can be expressed in three patterns of single animation depending on the interval specification: unfocus, focus, and when clicked.
        
        comipo
            Articulated character animation.
            Realizes smooth movements such as minute translation or rotation of hair or vertex transformation in skirts.
            
        effects
            bomb effect animations which use color blend and alpha blend animations.
        
        koma
            "Frame-by-frame animation" sample. Flipping through images in order to express robotic motion. "Reference Source XY Offset" is used to flip through images.

        vertex
            number
            number2
            Sample using "vertex transformation." A wide variety of movements can be expressed by combining with rotation.

    Scenes
    
        AntarcticScene
            Plays the animation group in the Data/antarctic folder.
        
        BeeScene
            Plays the animation group in the Data/BeeChameleon folder.
        
        ButtonScene
            Three types of button animations are placed in the Scene, and the SsButtonBehaviour script that monitors user operations is attached to them.
        
        ColliderScene
            SpriteObject demo with Collider attached.
        
        ComipoAllScene
            Plays the animation group in the Data/comipo folder.
        
        GameScene
            Sample that dynamically creates SpriteObjects with a script and then allocates animation.
            Sprite movement and collision detection are also performed with key input.
            Details follow below.
    
        MultiCamera
            Realized by adding a "2D" layer to for UI, setting Culling Mask for UI camera to only the 2D layer, and setting Clear Flags to DepthOnly.
            The layer named "2D" is in a blank state unless the TagsandLayers file is imported.
            See TagsandLayers below for details.

        NumberScene
            Plays the animation group in the Data/vertex folder.
            Sample animation of vertex transformation.
        
        RoboScene
            Plays the animation group in the Data/koma folder.
            Sample of data created with Frame-by-frame animation.

    TagsAndLayers
    
        Contains the "2D" layer name used with the MultiCamera sample.
        By opening and importing this, the current project Tag Manager list is updated.
        Note that when importing into an existing project, the original tag names and layer names will be overwritten.
