SpriteStudioPlayer for Unity is a tool to create 2d animation data and
an asset to play and manage animation data created with SpriteStudio.

Complex, rich 2D animations created with SpriteStudio can be easily
reproduced with Unity.
* Expresses multi-jointed animations in key frames
  -> Multi-jointed characters that were difficult to express with
tradition frame animation can be represented with few resources
* Can be used together with other 3D assets in Unity
  -> Can also be used in partial 2D production such as HUD or effects
* Displayed animations are controlled from the game script
  -> Animation exchanges according to user input can be expressed


[Cautions]
This asset is a player to play and manage SpriteStudio animation data.
The animation data is created with the standalone SpriteStudio.
